# Bitchmap
Basically im trying to do some impossible shit but I can make this work I think.
It's going to function as an everything-you-ever-needed colorbass pluggin.

## Resources
- Going to see if I can implement this using JUCE
https://juce.com/learn/documentation/

- Also going to fetch serial keys using queries from a databricks sql relational DBMS
https://www.databricks.com/product/databricks-sql

## Features
  - Built in disperser
  - Built in Transient shaper of sorts
  - Built in pre(timbre/noctane moment) frequency shifter 
  - Built in post(microtones) frequency shifter
  - Built in resonators (no different from ableton)
  
  - Option to be vocoder external (snap to input midi notes)
  - Option to be vocoder internal (snap to selected notes)
  
  Planned fixes from the Original Pitchmap
  - Purify knob is not aids when cranked all the way up
  - Doesnt crash computer/ableton due to high cpu usage
